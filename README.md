# Sales Analysis Project
Project Objective:
The objective of this sales analysis project is to help AAL (an Australian apparel brand) make informed decisions for future business expansion by analyzing Q4 sales data. Specifically, the project aims to:

Identify top-performing states based on sales revenue.

Highlight underperforming states to develop targeted sales programs.

Analyze sales trends across demographics (Kids, Women, Men, Seniors).

Discover peak vs. off-peak sales periods to support marketing strategies.

Generate weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports for data-driven planning.

Present insights through visual dashboards for the Sales & Marketing team.

This is done using data wrangling, analysis, and visualization in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn) inside a JupyterLab Notebook.
